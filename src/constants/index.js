export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I’m a software engineer with 2 years of experience in front-end technologies, but my journey didn’t stop there. Driven by a curiosity to uncover the stories hidden in data, I transitioned into the data field to explore its power to solve complex problems and drive impactful decisions.

Proficient in Python, SQL, and Power BI, I have a strong foundation in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and dashboard creation. Leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I excel at extracting actionable insights and developing predictive models using machine learning techniques. I specialize in communicating complex data through compelling visualizations and presentations, supporting informed decision-making. Additionally, my expertise in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS enables me to build interactive and user-friendly data applications.

I thrive in collaborative team environments and quickly adapt to dynamic challenges. Driven by a passion for data-driven solutions, I focus on developing innovative analytics that address critical business needs. My goal is to continue growing as a Data Scientist, using my expanding knowledge to drive meaningful impact through analytics and innovation.`;
